How similar are the connections within in a region -- is taking a mean the right idea? How do these compare across regions? violin plot sorted by median - plot every 20? histogram? across people? across region?

Make average - no need to threshold beforehand etc - so actually easier than you think - just add together!

Make deterministic into probabilities

Make some repeat analyses

Binarized measures like slide 74 for fMRI

WEIGHTED

Negative values? Threshold (at 0? at different levels?)
